# Hello, world

You can download a PDF version of the Markdown you commited and pushed to any branch by clicking the check icon next to the commit name, clicking through to the tick section, switching to the 'Summary' view in the sidebar, scrolling down to the 'Artifacts' section, and downloading the generated file `render.pdf`.[^1]

[^1]: In future it may be more convenient to set the action up to commit directly to the repo, but this will do for a demo.

I encourage you all to try creating your own branches and trying this out.
