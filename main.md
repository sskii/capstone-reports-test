# Hello, world

You can download a PDF version of the Markdown you commited and pushed by clicking the check icon next to the commit name, clicking through to the tick section, switching to the 'Summary' view in the sidebar, scrolling down to the 'Artifacts' section, and downloading the generated file `render.pdf`.[^1]

[^1]: In future it may be more convenient to set the action up to commit directly to the repo, but this will do for a demo.

## Trying this out

Feel free to push test commits to try this out. The action responds to pushes on any branch, so feel free to create your own.

## Why Markdown?

You can still type inline \LaTeX if you really want and if you know what you're doing there. The advantage of this method using Actions is that we can use Git to version everything and keep collaboration in the same place, all without having to worry about TeX with its verbose syntax and frequent errors all semseter.
